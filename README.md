## **Introduction**

Super Soukoban is a puzzle game developed by THINKING RABBIT and published by PACK-IN-VIDEO for the Super Nintendo in 1998. The main objective of the game is to move boxes to designated locations within each level using the fewest possible moves. This game combines strategy and logic, making it perfect for those who enjoy mental challenges.

## **Storyline**

In Super Soukoban, you play as a warehouse worker who must organize boxes scattered around different levels. Each level represents a new challenge where you must use your wits to place all the boxes in their proper spots. The game doesn't have a complex storyline, but its simplicity is part of its charm, focusing on pure puzzle-solving gameplay.

## **Strategies and Tips**

- **Plan Ahead:** Before moving a box, consider the consequences of each move.
- **Use Undo:** Don’t hesitate to use the undo function to correct mistakes.
- **Move Boxes in Order:** Try to solve levels by moving one box at a time towards its destination.
- **Avoid Corners:** Unless the target spot is in a corner, avoid pushing boxes into corners as it may be hard to get them out.

- **Undo Feature:** The undo feature is a critical tool to refine your strategy and correct mistakes.
